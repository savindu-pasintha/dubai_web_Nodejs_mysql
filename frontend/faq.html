                                <div class="toggle-content">
                                    <p>One of our most frequently asked questions around freight is in regards to cost and
                                        fluctuating prices throughout the year. For businesses trying to keep ahead of these
                                        varying costs it can be frustrating.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The demand for shipping services is subject to a number of external pressures,
                                        including those of a political, economic and environmental nature. Trade sanctions,
                                        conflict, consumer behaviour, bad weather and more can affect demand, and that in
                                        turn affects cost. As there isn’t a single predictor or reason in the market, but a
                                        varying of factors including (but not limited to): </p>
                                    <p>Destination/distance – the more popular the destination and the shorter the journey,
                                        the lower the ocean freight rate. Less common destinations, including those with a
                                        reduced capacity to handle freight, are more costly, and the further goods have to
                                        travel, the greater the ocean freight rate will be.</p>
                                    <p>Currency – as ocean freight rate is charged in US dollars, the exchange rate has an
                                        impact on cost. Cargo type – the types of goods that are likely to attract higher fees
                                        include those that are dangerous, heavy, perishable, or out of gauge (OOG). </p>
                                    <p>Fuel Costs – Bunker Fuel, that’s the name for fuel used to power a ship’s engines, and
                                        the cost can fluctuate, meaning the ocean freight rate charged will fluctuate. Bunker
                                        fuel has a big impact on the cost of ocean freight. </p>
                                    <p>Seasons – certain goods are in demand, or in higher demand, due to the seasons, for
                                        example, in the run up to Christmas or the Chinese New Year. When demand is high
                                        prices often rise, whereas when demand is low, they fall.</p>
                                    <p>Vessel size – as the biggest single cost in ocean freight is bunker fuel, the size and
                                        capacity of the vessel is important. Bigger vessels might use more fuel, but there are
                                        also more containers on board for that cost to be shared between. </p>
                                    <p>Environment – 1 January 2020 saw the implementation of IMO 2020, new legislation
                                        introduced by the International Maritime Organisation. The aim is to reduce sulphur
                                        oxide gas emissions by using marine fuels with a maximum sulphur content of 0.5%,
                                        a hefty reduction compared to the previous limit of 3.5%. The expectation is an increase in cost.</p>

                                    <p>Delayed shipments are one of the most frustrating parts of freight forwarding for
                                        many companies – the time involved, additional costs and waiting customers which
                                        has the potential to incur a larger cost (potentially losing clients/ customers). Vessels
                                        essentially move in a giant loop, calling from port to port then back again. if one tiny
                                        delay occurs at one port it can cause a chain reaction for all the other ports that the
                                        particular vessel calls in on, this can add days or even weeks to a transit time. Things
                                        that can cause these delays are:

                                    <p>This is quite a large question but we will try to answer as briefly as possible. There
                                        are several risks to consider as a shipper but these can be mitigated with the following
                                        steps: exercise due diligence when choosing a carrier (trust the experience of your
                                        forwarder or broker here as well); be a stickler for paperwork and pay special
                                        attention to bills of lading and waybills; communicate clearly with everyone in the
                                        chain, including the broker, forwarder, shipping company and recipient. Make sure
                                        you have sufficient insurance coverage and be aware of who is liable for losses and
                                        damage and to what degree.
