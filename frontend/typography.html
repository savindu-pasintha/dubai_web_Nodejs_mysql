                                    which was held by Morley until earlier this year when he departed just six months
                                    after he’d started. Morley was the first senior staff member appointed by former
                                    group MD Cris Stephenson, who took the role in June
                                    2014. Stephenson was then replaced by former Palletline MD Kevin Buchanan in
                                    November of that year.</p>
